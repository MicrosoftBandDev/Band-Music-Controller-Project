# MS-Band-Music-Controller
I have created this PDF full of data in order to show that the Microsoft Band 2 and other aged devices can still be useful. The Band 2 can be used as a Bluetooth music controller with some devices and this document can help show which ones/ which operating systems can utilize it. Of the the firmwares my various Band 2s have, I have found that those within the Build Version 2.0.5XXX.0 series have the music control features while those with the Build Version 2.0.3XXX.0 series do not.
