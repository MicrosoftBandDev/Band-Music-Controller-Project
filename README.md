# MS-Band-Music-Controller
I have created this PDF full of data in order to show that the Microsoft Band 2 and other aged devices can still be useful. 
The Band 2 can be used as a Bluetooth music controller with some devices and this document can help show which ones/ which operating systems can utilize it.
